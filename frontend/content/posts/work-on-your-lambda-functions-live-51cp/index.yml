title: "Work on your Lambda functions live"
excerpt: "AWS CDK has been great for us and our readers over on Serverless Stack. But the local development experience for Lambda isn't great. To fix this we created a Live Lambda Development environment in SST. SST makes it easier to build serverless apps by allowing you to work on your Lambda functions locally while connecting to your deployed resources."
